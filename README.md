* **`/multisig`**: Covers the **Spikey Multisig Wallet**, an on-chain vault requiring multiple approvals for transactions.
* **`/spikeyfun`**: General information about the **$SPIKE token**, including tokenomics, governance, and the **Spikey Genesis NFT** collection.
* **`/spikeygames`**: Terms for the **Memeverse**, the **Souls system** (SBTs/EXP), and fair games powered by **Supra’s dVRF**.

## ✅ The Approval Process

Once you submit a Pull Request, our technical team will review it:
* **JSON Validation**: We check that the file format is correct (no missing commas or quotes).
* **Context Check**: We ensure technical terms (like "Bonding Curve" or "Fungible Assets") are translated accurately within the Spikey context.
* **Approval**: Once verified, we will **Approve and Merge** your contribution into the main branch, making it live for the ecosystem!

## 💡 Important Context for Translators

To provide the best translations, keep these core principles in mind:
* **Multisig is a Vault**: Ensure users understand that the Multisig is for storage and cannot interact directly with other dApps.
* **Souls are EXP**: In the Memeverse, "Souls" are non-transferable tokens that act as experience points for leveling up Digital Assets.
* **Bonding Curve**: This is the mathematical formula used in the Launchpad to determine token price based on supply and demand.
* **Zap Feature**: In Spikey Swap, "Zap" allows users to provide liquidity using only one type of token instead of two.
